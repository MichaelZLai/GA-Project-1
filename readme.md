## Approach Taken
[1] Initially I did some research on hangman games on the web to generate ideas and envision what my hangman would look like.
[2] Then I created my project folder and added index.html, script.js, and styles.css.
[3] I was initially stumped at where to start since I was dealing with a blank canvas. That's where creating psuedo code helped me methodically plan out each individual functions of my game.
[4] After that I started with some simple html elements and styling them before delving into the javascript.
[5] I used a mix of javascript and jQuery (write less, do more!) to make my game. Originally I had just a still image and letters in my game. Then I added my functions and if statements to render a hangman game.
[6] After hours of troubleshooting, the hangman game worked! Well, the base worked. There were still some bugs to work out.
[7] Next steps were making it pretty and cleaning/commenting the code for easier reference.
[8] Now it's time for presentation.


## Unsolved Problems
I still have some problems I need to address, however I do consider this a gold level submit! Some of the problems are:
[1] Binding keyboard events to the alphabet letters.
[2] When a user loses a game, he/she can still click on letters and producing negative limbs.
